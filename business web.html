                <p>One of the most influential books of the past fifty years, Team of Rivals is Pulitzer Prize–winning
                    author and esteemed presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's modern classic about the political
                    genius of Abraham Lincoln, his unlikely presidency, and his cabinet of former political foes.
                    Winner of the prestigious Lincoln Prize and the inspiration for the Oscar Award winning–film Lincoln
                    , starring Daniel Day-Lewis, directed by Steven Spielberg, and written by Tony Kushner.
                    On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in
                    their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln
                    emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.
                    Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over
                    slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin
                    demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him
                    above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary
                    ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to
                    understand their motives and desires.
                    It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together,
                    create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the
                    Union and winning the war.
                    We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with
                    incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by
                    winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial
                    friend to see him through.
                    This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most
                    significant presidency in the nation's history.</p>

                <p>The Harry Potter series of books and movies are wildly popular. Many Christians see the books as
                    largely if not entirely harmless. Others regard them as dangerous and misleading. In his book A
                    Landscape with Dragons, Harry Potter critic Michael O'Brien examines contemporary children's
                    literature and finds it spiritually and morally wanting. His analysis, written before the rise of
                    the popular Potter books and films, anticipates many of the problems Harry Potter critics point to.
                    A Landscape with Dragons is a controversial, yet thoughtful study of what millions of young people
                    are reading and the possible impact such reading may have on them.

                    In this study of the pagan invasion of children's culture, O'Brien, the father of six, describes his
                    own coming to terms with the effect it has had on his family and on most families in Western
                    society. His analysis of the degeneration of books, films, and videos for the young is incisive and
                    detailed. Yet his approach is not simply critical, for he suggests a number of remedies, including
                    several tools of discernment for parents and teachers in assessing the moral content and spiritual
                    impact of this insidious revolution. In doing so, he points the way to rediscovery of time-tested
                    sources, and to new developments in Christian culture.

                    If you have ever wondered why a certain children's book or film made you feel uneasy, but you
                    couldn't figure out why, this book is just what you need. This completely revised, much expanded
                    second edition also includes a very substantial recommended reading list of over 1,000 books for
                    kindergarten through highschool.</p>

                <p>In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life journey of John
                    Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot who spared
                    nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second president of the
                    United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond
                    all but a few and regarded by some as “out of his senses”; and whose marriage to the wise and
                    valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history.

                    This is history on a grand scale—a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about
                    human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship, and betrayal, and the
                    far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all,<i>John Adams</i> is an enthralling, often
                    surprising
                    story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.</p>

                <p>Written four hundred years before the birth of Christ, this detailed contemporary account of the
                    struggle between Athens and Sparta stands an excellent chance of fulfilling the author's ambitious
                    claim that the work "was done to last forever." The conflicts between the two empires over shipping,
                    trade, and colonial expansion came to a head in 431 b.c. in Northern Greece, and the entire Greek
                    world was plunged into 27 years of war. Thucydides applied a passion for accuracy and a contempt for
                    myth and romance in compiling this exhaustively factual record of the disastrous conflict that
                    eventually ended the Athenian empire.

                <p>Fascinating and highly readable, this book recounts the history of mathematics as revealed in the
                    lives and writings of the most distinguished practitioners of the art: Archimedes, Descartes,
                    Fermat, Pascal, Newton, Leibniz, Euler, Gauss, Hamilton, Einstein, and many more. Author Stuart
                    Hollingdale introduces and explains the roles of these gifted and often colorful figures in the
                    development of mathematics as well as the ways in which their work relates to mathematics as a
                    whole. Although the emphasis in this absorbing survey is primarily biographical, Hollingdale also
                    discusses major historical themes and explains new ideas and techniques. No specialized mathematical
                    knowledge on the part of the reader is assumed. Superbly informative, this volume offers an
                    accessible, interesting guide to one of the pillars of modern science, and to a supremely important
                    aspect of human culture through the ages.</p>

                <p>In A Short History of Nearly Everything , the bestselling author of A Walk in the Woods and The Body,
                    confronts his greatest challenge yet: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest
                    questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as his territory everything from
                    the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being
                    nothing at all to there being us . The result is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always
                    supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can

                    many popular myths about the wars of independence and reveals in fact how many Americans wished to
                    remain British, and how many British had profound doubts about a military solution to the revolt. It
                    shows that many of those fighting knew those on the other side well, and as the great decisions and
                    battles of 1776 unfolded and attitudes hardened, the truly fratricidal nature of the conflict became
                    clear. A must read. This exhilarating book is one of the great peices of historical narrative.</p>

                    comrade she’s in love with? Can she really be a part of the movement or is she just a “useful fool,”
                    a spoiled brat playing at revolution?

                    Far from the Philippines, in a mansion overlooking the Hudson River, Sol confesses her youthful
                    indiscretions, unable to get past the fatal act of communist fervor that locked her memory in an
                    endless loop. Rich with wordplay and unforgettable imagery, Gun Dealers’ Daughter combines the
                    momentum of an amnesiac thriller with the intellectual delights of a Borgesian puzzle. In her
                    American debut, award-winning author Gina Apostol delivers a riveting novel that illuminates the
                    conflicted and little-known history of the Philippines, a country deeply entwined with our own.</p>

                <p>A New York Times Top Ten Book of the Year and National Book Award finalist, Pachinko is an
                    "extraordinary epic" of four generations of a poor Korean immigrant family as they fight to control
                    their destiny in 20th-century Japan (San Francisco Chronicle).

                    "There could only be a few winners and a lot of losers. And yet we played on because we had hope
                    that we might be the lucky ones."
                    In the early 1900s, teenaged Sunja, the adored daughter of a crippled fisherman, falls for a wealthy
                    stranger at the seashore near her home in Korea. He promises her the world, but when she discovers
                    she is pregnant--and that her lover is married--she refuses to be bought. Instead, she accepts an
                    offer of marriage from a gentle, sickly minister passing through on his way to Japan. But her
                    decision to abandon her home, and reject her son's powerful father, sets off a dramatic saga that
                    will echo down through the generations. Richly told and profoundly moving, Pachinko is a story of
                    love, sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty. From bustling street markets to the halls of Japan's finest
                    universities to the pachinko parlours of the criminal underworld, Min Jin Lee's complex and
                    passionate characters - strong, stubborn women, devoted sisters and sons, and fathers shaken by
                    moral crisis - survive and thrive against the indifferent arc of history.</p>

                    In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us
                    how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.

                    For decades, we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k
                    positivity, " Mark Manson says. "Let's be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In
                    his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn't sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a
                    dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a
                    F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mindset that has infectedmodern society
                    and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.

                    Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that
                    improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to
                    stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary,
                    there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises
                    us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and
                    uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin
                    to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.

                    There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really
                    matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better,
                    because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed
                    grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining
                    stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a refreshing slap for a
                    generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p>

                <p>No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving—every day. James Clear,
                    one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach
                    you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to
                    remarkable results.

                    If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system.
                    Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you
                    have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level
                    of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.

                    Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily
                    applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology,
                    and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad
                    habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from
                    Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star
                    comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of
                    their field.



                    Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and
                    strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship,
                    an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking,
                    lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.</p>

                <p>This book presents an exploration of sleep, explaining how we can harness its transformative power to
                    change our lives for the better. Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of
                    our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why
                    we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we
                    don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life - eating, drinking, and reproducing - the
                    purpose of sleep remained elusive. An explosion of scientific discoveries has shed new light on this
                    fundamental aspect of our lives. The author, a neuroscientist and sleep expert, offers an
                    exploration of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Within the brain, sleep enriches our
                    ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our
                    immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful
                    memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to
                    inspire creativity. The author answers important questions about sleep: how do caffeine and alcohol
                    affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a
                    lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us and can they cause long-term damage? Charting
                    cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice,
                    the author explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate
                    hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity;
                    enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and
                    productivity of our businesses.--description provided by publisher</p>
