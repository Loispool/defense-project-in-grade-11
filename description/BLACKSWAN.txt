Nassim Nicholas Taleb's "The Black Swan" posits that rare and unpredictable events, termed Black Swans, have unprecedented impacts on the world and human history. These events are characterized by their outlier status, extreme consequences, and the human tendency to rationalize them after they occur. Taleb discusses the intellectual hubris that leads society to underestimate the significance of these events, particularly in the realms of finance and economics, where traditional risk assessments fail to account for them.
